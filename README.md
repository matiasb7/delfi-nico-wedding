# Wedding Site
This project is a throwback! Built for a wedding, it features a custom 'guests' post type to keep track of attendees and comes with a REST API for data handling. It's not yet the final versionâ€”there's a to-do list for future tweaks. Dive into the wedding mu-plugin for API details. Heads up: it's ripe for an update to meet the latest web standards.
